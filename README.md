# Zero-Trust Core

Shared foundation for every Zero-Trust app (Fitness, Contacts, Tasks, Notes, …): one account, one key hierarchy, one vault lock, one look.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `packages/zt_crypto` | Pure Dart: canonical base64, AES-256-GCM sealed boxes, Ed25519, PBKDF2/HKDF, key hierarchy, recovery key |
| `packages/zero_trust_core` | Flutter: account service (sign-up, sign-in with legacy upgrade, change password, recovery, delete account), vault lock with auto-lock, shared theme |
| `supabase/migrations` | The only schema source of truth for the shared Supabase project |
| `supabase/functions/delete-account` | Edge Function behind in-app account deletion |

## Key hierarchy

```
password -PBKDF2(600k, salt=H(email))-> master key -HKDF-> auth secret  (the only thing Supabase sees)
                                                   -HKDF-> KEK
random DEK, sealed under the KEK and under the recovery key (profiles.wrapped_dek / recovery_wrapped_dek)
DEK -HKDF("zt/app/<id>/v1")-> per-app data key
```

Changing the password re-wraps the DEK; no data is re-encrypted. Accounts created by pre-core app versions are upgraded on first sign-in and keep their existing key as the DEK, so existing data stays readable.

## Using it from an app

```yaml
dependencies:
  zero_trust_core:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/EdoSag/Zero-Trust-Core.git
      path: packages/zero_trust_core
```

```dart
ProviderScope(
  overrides: [ztAppConfigProvider.overrideWithValue(
    const ZtAppConfig(appId: 'notes', displayName: 'Zero-Trust Notes'))],
  child: MaterialApp(theme: ZtTheme.light(), darkTheme: ZtTheme.dark(), home: ...),
);
```

### Shared screens

`ZtSignInScreen`, `ZtUnlockScreen`, `ZtRecoveryKeyScreen`,
`ZtForgotPasswordScreen`, `ZtResetPasswordScreen` and `ZtSettingsPage` are the
same in every app. Each auth screen hands back an `UnlockResult`; pass its
`dek` to `vaultControllerProvider.notifier.unlock`, and when
`newRecoveryKey` is set, show `ZtRecoveryKeyScreen` first. Apps add their own
settings rows through `ZtSettingsPage(appSection: [...], backupSection: [...])`.

### Sync

```dart
final vault = ref.read(vaultControllerProvider) as VaultUnlocked;
final sync = ItemSyncEngine(
  appId: 'notes',
  appKey: vault.appKey,
  deviceId: deviceId,                 // stable per install
  store: myDriftOrIsarStore,          // implements LocalItemStore
  backend: SupabaseSyncBackend(),
  signingKeys: await KeyHierarchy.signingKeys(vault.appKey),
);
await sync.save(note.id, note.toJson());
final result = await sync.sync();     // pull, then push
sync.startLive();                     // realtime from other devices
```

Every item is its own encrypted, signed row in `vault_items`; conflicts are
last-writer-wins and the losing local edit comes back in
`result.conflicts`, so the app can offer to restore it.

## Tests

```bash
(cd packages/zt_crypto && dart pub get && dart test)
(cd packages/zero_trust_core && flutter pub get && flutter test)
```
